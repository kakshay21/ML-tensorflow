#ML-tensorflow
I initialy started with MNIST_soft.py from google tutorials.
This was a very simpler model and good for a starter. 
But the problem with that model was it's accuracy just 92%.
Then i changed the neural model and added two hiddenlayer and
that enchanced the accuracy to 95%.
So i thought of adding one more layer in that model but
went in vain as accuracy has fallen upto 0.05%
That made me realise to change the neural model and i'm working on it.
